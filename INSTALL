=== SIMPLE

  * cd into ./all/

  * ./install.sh /full/path/to/a/nfs/mounted/directory/

  * the nfs mounted path above should be visible by all cluster nodes.
    __all__ required software will be installed into this directory root. when
    complete all that's needed is a

      export PATH=/full/path/to/a/nfs/mounted/directory/bin:$PATH

    (note 'bin') to use rq

  * this is the __reccomended__ procedure since it will result in a single nfs
    install which all cluster nodes can use.  the other install methods mean
    you will have to install rq on __each__ node you plan to use it on.

=== RUBYGEMS

  * gem install rq

=== STANDARD

  * install all packages in ./depends/packages manually

  * ruby install.rb
